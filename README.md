# World-Cities-Database-Project
This project takes a CSV file and imports it to a MySQL database running on a Rocky Linux Server.

It starts by creating a new user so that I'm not dealing with the database as root. Then, I download a CSV file from Simplemaps and I transfer the CSV to my Rocky Linux server via SFTP with Filezilla.
